## Description

Horiseon wanted their site optimized for search engines so I created this project to help a marketing agency refactor an existing site for more accessibility. I learned how to code semantic HTML elements in a logical structure, apply alt attributes and source links for images, linking a CSS sheet to the HTML sheet and other meta data, style CSS using universale/element/class selectors, applying margin/height/width/padding/etc. to the css selectors, and refactoring the code in the Scout Rule (always leave code cleaner than you found it)!
