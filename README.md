## Description

Horiseon wanted their site optimized for search engines. I created this project to help a marketing agency refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. This can ensure people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions and screen readers. I learned how to code semantic HTML elements in a logical structure, alt attributes for images, refactoring code in the Scout Rule (always leave code cleaner than you found it)
